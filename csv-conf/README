## Introduction, approximately

People talk about "data analysis". I don't really know what that means.
But it seems to involve a CSV file. People try to figure out something
fancy based on the file.

Maybe they use a few CSV files.

And maybe from different places.

And they learn neat things.

And we might have a few different people working on different analysis

I've apparently done a lot of analysis, so I've looked at a few CSV files
in my life. (show the slide with some CSVs) But there are a lot of CSVs
that I haven't looked at.

Like this many.

And I'm not going to lbe able to look at them through this normal analysis
paradigm that I just vaguely described.

But I wanted to know what was in these CSV files, so I tried doing that.

As I said before, my general approach is to do stupid things lots of times.

I downloaded a bunch of CSV files from a bunch of "open data" sites.
I don't really know what "open data" means, but these sites are sites that
have a lot of spreadsheets organized in some systematic way.

And then I did silly things with them.
For example, I started out by looking at  this and this.

Another one that people liked was...

Here's another one that was popular, though it's not as strongly about
the contents of files. I found this price list for Socrata...
